# README
Ever since coming across [Matt Daniel's Rapper Vocabulary Chart](https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html), I've been interested in how one of my favorite rappers -- Buck 65 -- would place on there, and this is my attempt at finding that out.

## TL;DR
It's 6,557 unique words, which would put him in 3rd place on the chart.

## Instructions
Everything that you need to reproduce these results is included in the file. Due to copyright concerns, I haven't included any of the lyrics data in my repository, but `buck65.ipynb` has all of the steps to gather it.
First up will be setting up the conda environment. Running `setup.sh` should suffice to install all dependencies and start up a conda enviornment, but if it doesn't try running the commands:
```sh
$ conda env create --file environment.yml #creates the enviornment from the YAML file
$ conda activate buck65 # activates the enviornment
```

After that, you will need to get Genius API access. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.genius.com/) to get that set up. Once you have your keys, create a copy of `secrets.json.template` called `secrets.json` and copy in your Genius API keys, or at least your client access token under the field `CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`. With that done, you should be able to reproduce my results. 

**NB:** You may notice two cells that are totally commented out. The first time you run this notebook, you'll need to uncomment the code in those cells in order to fetch the data. After that, feel free to recomment them. They only need to be run once, and take a long time to run.
