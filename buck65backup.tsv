Achilles And The Tortoise		Man Overboard	this collection of sketches rough and scattered is arranged by instinct theres entropy at work but mostly it happened by accident sure a story goes with this but for it to make sense youd have to be me and for it to make dollars i would have to be something i despise dont ask me how i managed no one gets paid to make change every morning i salute the flag turn grab the fingers of my left hand behind my back and continue my search im wondering how i got here who besides me is responsible im not the young man i was when i first wrote the code now i dont have it in me to fuss over much i need sleep more than ever before what remains of my violence is so precious that i keep it all of it to myself what frightens me most now is my gradual loss of hearing so im guided more and more by vibes i shield my eyes from flickering images and document my dreams with as much detail as possible i figure ill write my book when its all i can do but i dont know have you any idea how hot these sands are ya i come in contact with the odd scavenger here and there but those encounters rarely amount to much i just gaze the same few black and white photographs distant loves long lost souls diamonds of my most glorious moments i remember the gold rush ya she makes me laugh now to think of the risks i took the monuments will remain and thats all that matters but the question always becomes am i happy  when young we mourn for one woman when we grow old for woman in general the tradgey in life is man is never free yet strives for what can never be the thing most feared in secret always happens my life my love where are they now but the more the pain grows the more this instinct for life somehow asserts itself the necessary beauty in life is giving yourself to it completely only later will it clarify itself as not coherant  i wandered the fields and listen for the sound of drums the colder the ground becomes the closer i get i home the planets not fit to roam but with all the chaos but when i saw the savages i played the law of averages and when the river splits in half i start to lose my wits and laugh and cry at the same time theres nothing i can do about it even though i wouldnt doubt it if the winds began to blow and carry the sounds of my voice to the lands below so i put my hands around my mouth and hollered to the sunken city that wallows in the filth of its own drunken pity and wait to see a signal but a signal is never seen eventually fatigue builds inside me exponentially and so i sleep and dream that im able to fly they will respect a man with wings later i awake in agony and learn that while i was sleeping the city had burned shrugging my shoulders i paused and gathered thoughts think twice about staying put then decide i rather not so i press on in my agnostic pilgrimage knowing that i can swim deeper than the grim reaper ready for whatever sea creatures may abound when the water swallows me and not the other way around survival saw me through the mechanical district starvation leads to being cannibalistic i have to rely on cons and silence and on talking quick defending myself with nothing but this walking stick ive never had friends and no parental guidance im wild at heart and weird on top im feared nonstop even though my rage is worn out my lifes a book with several pages torn out i just climb trees and look for rhythm everywhere i used to be the town crier in a city of stone throwers until my soul was laid bare and displayed in the pearled square ignored more than a lot not less no one understood my thought process i was gagged and bound over noise complaints but commanding the resolve that destroys constraints i found my escape in a melding of memories the next thing i know im rowing this boat and blowing this note on an old tarnished trumpet pause for trumpet sample ever since then ive been wandering lots watching the sky and pondering thoughts strange angel music box genie behind for some time and now im blind in one eye and how this happened exactly will never be known my thoughts take the shape of the hang mans house never fails in time traveling salesman visiting

scorched earth always just out of reach a murder of crows judged my every footstep my bones were frozen penniless and entirely out of breath i washed my beautiful hands in the black market dog water trough but through it all the real stick in my spokes was the torment of my dreams i fought of sleep with both fists and sometimes fire with no more than a blow gun i made from an exhausted pen i shot the stars out of the sky when each one fell sparkling to the ground i made wishes that never came true apparitions of angels with angry eyes appeared at each new moon my own ghost be gain whispering

straight line you see a lot of things in the distance you know what they say about great minds you and i think about the same things dream the same dreams play the same games we started out in the same place believe it or not we got the same names everything happens for a good cause whether it be victory or loss and the road may turn into a run way but youll know what to do someday trust me ive seen it all before ive climbed to the tops of the tallest trees to get away from the deep water to find the touch of the smallest breeze youll find a girl with a low voice who holds the world in her bare hands youll fall in love youll have no choice once you are given a fair chance for the first time you will sleep well take a deep breath see the sun shine hold on to her for dear life and then watch the whole world unwind ask her to show you some magic and i guarantee that she will say yes tell her youve seen forever and youll be together not a day less just know until that time comes and after you cross that first mile that the hardest part is behind you and all of the pain will be worthwhile from storm clouds come angels let pain give you pleasure from dirt grows the flower when faith cant be measured from storm clouds come angels let pain give you pleasure from dirt grows the flower when faith cant be measured 0905 song 4 i know a man who was born with his heart on the outside every mans worst fear he also had heavy hands he couldnt touch his lovers face he couldnt hold a baby he would never desert them but he was worried he would hurt them maybe mad at the world his face turned hot pink the best he could do was just try to not think but he was too bothered so he would only try rarely he read the last page of every book in the library he lacked the charisma of a true revolutionary crime fighter would try to write but kept breaking his typewriter he preaches manifesto like a militant radical was diligent but his greatest mistakes were grammatical if he only spent more time rehearsing and preparing there wouldnt have to be so much cursing and swearing eyes on fire his volume was blistering no one had taught him about the power of whispering he is dynamite blows kisses eats dirt his mouth of a volcano he is a t shirt he stands on stilts but doesnt stand for funny stuff ask me he just hasnt been around the sun enough he paints self portraits with a roller only eats corn and then tries to sell his own soul on a street corner he always remembers everyones numbers and sometimes cries into his own cumbersome hands scratching mixes 1138 song 5 sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall and like sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall read beginning to end and measured sideways ive traveled the length of your desert highways been under your bed and slept in ditches i saw your scars was kept in stitches to keep from crying im trying not to pay attention but as i may have mentioned im being held hostage im lost and exhausted i want to go home now but im too far gone and i dont even know how the silent knight and tarnished armor charming and harmful the charma chameleon might get violent dancing with shadows and playing charades its the minimal plan of the invisible man and whats it like living life you may ask standing on the other side a two way glass well its not what its cracked up to be ill tell you that much you can look but you cant touch like sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall and like sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall all i want to do is go fly a kite or take a hike and try and keep myself from taking a flying leap theres ringing in my ears especially at night kaleidoscopic visions of a cocaine cat fight people play parlor games behind closed doors secrets are sacred when nobody knows yours but somebody does you forgot about the bottom feeders the dirty rotten cheaters and all of the stock breeders sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall and like sometimes dumb crimes blow my mind and lord knows i try to close my eyes but it happens so fast i keep my eye on the ball but still i never asked to be a fly on the wall
Square Two	2002-01-01	Square	song 1 the man with the hair would talk real loud he made feel proud for not being afraid he helped me get over my fear of the dark and of the unknown in the year of the shark wed meet in secret at the ends of the weeks and we were friends of the freaks and the misunderstood wed listen to jazz or go for a drive and im just glad we both were alive and everyone knew that the giant was john and no one had heard him once say a bad word some say hes perverted or maybe a manchild just cause his imagination ran wild and whats wrong with that in a world gone a fishing you want to run away from a man on a mission wow bob wow wake up and smell the coffee enjoy the scenery and the sounds of machinery me and the man with the hair would compare notes we both wear boots and drink rootbeer floats we told jokes with old folks and lit things on fire and we all fall down in a small small town but now its dark and we follow the weird words of murmuring burglars and murderers further than our father figures the nasty ghastly devious and blasphemous provides a more lasting fascination for us both song 2   stupid appeared on the album boy girl fight swimming upstream young men and women are fiending for immediate intimacy with no limitiations alas the skirts dont hide the shadows cast by the bare ass on the dancefloor sexual warfare waits in the staircase and therefore most of them probably shouldnt even really be there in the first place unarmed soldiers of lust rub shoulders with those older and more immature than them its disgusting yet intruiging to see overachieving greasers unleashing themselves upon the female species especially when the weather gets warmer and then the whole entire wardrobe is normally informal for your information the hats are worn backwards and so are the morals when the girls wear overalls its a sensitive issue involving insecurity maturity levels and lots of toilet tissue cause the girls are desperate but the boys are even hornier the rose smells sweet but the stem is even thornier its a match made in purgatory what more do you want to know the girls get goosebumps and nipples to notice but no one knows how to communicate its useless when lies are told with closed eyes and everybody tries to disguise their own flaws when the guys go we need females and we read details its card tricks and hard dicks and a beat that goes like uh uh uh yeah uh huh uh uh yeah the neat part of the meat market apart from the darkness and lots of narcotics to me is the hard rocks no one needs to be told twice theres plenty of cold ice just tight pants and old spice who take shots and roll dice the carpets are crumby with puke coming out of them its putrid and stupid why dont you make a contribution to the plan gathering as a matter fact word what do you say this thursday the girls are desperate but the boys are even hornier the rose smells sweet but the stem is even thornier its a match made in purgatory what more do you want to know it smells like everything inside of the hideout but i doubt anyone really wants to know why oh my goodness gracious the place is basically bulging with people indulging in all kinds of fabric its a magical buffet of pheromones and flesh that defies all logic its just like dodgeball but instead of a ball the contestants throw around the head of a doll and i dont know what it means but it makes it worth the cost alone even with the overflowing load of testosterone the sexual appetites are salty its a circus the circuits are faulty and everybodys uptight with sweat stains and jet planes and hot rod love songs blistering kisses for every mister and misses in the same of time it takes for you to make a sandwich love you can probably find someone for you to take advantage of cause the girls are desperate but the boys are even hornier the rose smells sweet but the stem is even thornier its a match made in purgatory what more do you want to know  song 3 my long

distracted by sleaziness even when we shouldve been practicing because back when we had peach fuzz he was freaking out each weekend and speaking of waiting for the end of the world he befriended a girl with a heart made of glass and was afraid to ask if he was falling in love falling asleep falling apart or all the above he was a fling and she was his weakness kissing his cheeks and playing with his paychecks at breakneck speed he was heading for a dead end pretending he was healthy and defending himself he would always exaggerate and use his imagination waiting for someone to say congradulations but i wasnt exactly happy for him actually after turning his back to me gradually i call it a tragedy watching him disappear this year its crystal clear listen here stop this crazy

know whyyou gotta try so hard jump so high and you run so fast and dont knwo whyyou gotta try again try try again  the try hards drive cars that need new parts they got vampire fangs and see thru hearts but they wouldnt be caught dead without the right clothes on the harder they try the more everything goes wrong the tryhards talk until the back of my neck hurts no matter what the topic is the experts the tryhards cant dance but do dance anyways then they say tryhards are kinda retarded but i wouldnt go that far i shoudl mention for starters theyre modern day maureders just dyin for attention yeah tryhards candy coated comedians live thru medium sized imaginations lies and exagerrations all on an average weekday they have a unique way of making you want to vomit drama slash nonsense akways part of the content opinions and comments from cowboys and indians climbin a steep hill just for a cheap thrill dancin queens cant seem to keep still the tryhards dotn sleep well they just toss and turn and im not concerned about it to tell you the truth they get on my nerves i refer to them as perverted earthworms as they prefer to play dirty the tryin hardest theyd probably say im an artist obvious novices that just feel so informed thats its even more annoying than being trapped in a toystore with hardcore rappers paraders and wannabes i say probably highway robbery aint worse than being pestered by this type of person tryhard children still throw tantrums on their mattresses in their mansions and pay attention fully to the bully with the headphones fascinated actually with makin a fashion statement tryhards dont know how to relax its ridiculous how he always overreacts the tryhards just go along for the ride i guess the need for speed can be stronger than pride  the tryhardsthey jump so high they run so fast and dont know why song 3   cries a girl or stella appeared on the other bucks albums i was raised on a dirt road ghost town stray dogs whole nine the gold mine closed down i knew the woods like the back of my hand and i would shoot the breeze with the roots and trees id go by the river and watch the way the devil dances but never took his hand even though i did have several chances everybody slept when the morning dew turned to frost darkness moved in and somebody burned a cross a girl named stella cuwin was prettier than youd imagine the town shouldve given her the crown for the beauty pageant but instead some local pinhead started spreading rumors about the cuwins being inbreds and whats worse people believed it cause the family was dirt poor and down on their luck so that made it hurt more picking up garbage and mowing the grass at this point stella stopped going to class you know how they ridicule a kid in school and this shits enough to make anybody feel like a misfit she made herself invisible and hid inside a house of mirrors whenever the fear stops so did the tear drops but fear is forever and lies become legend and eventually growing slowly exponentially she shouldve been a cover girl treated like a princess but shes an enigma haunted by the stigma of incest she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes one horse town known for the most softness little old schoolhouse burned down post office blueberries and bulrushes a tree with a tire swing volunteer firemans fair the whole entire thing stella was heartbroken decided to start smoking bad taste in her mouth she grew into a sad face her few friends were worried but her parents were always pround of her but she never escaped from under the cloud cover a woman reduced she was eaten by a monster and after all these years the past it still haunts her it whispers her name when shes trying instead to just listen to music while shes lying in bed now the story of stella is one that every child knows but the witch in the woods is more like a wild rose she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes

Craftsmanship		Talkin’ Honky Blues	most folks spend their days daydreaming or finding clues my whole life ive been here at the train station shining shoes i started when i was nine on my own and taught myself no complaints im doing pretty good and i got my health memories and calluses my hearings probably next to go sometimes i do a little handy work for extra dough but mostly this here is how i spend my time and ive perfected a technique i call the dry shine some guys use lots of water on the shoe but then when its out in the open air its gone in ten minutes that whole approach to the job is dumb in fact dollars to donuts that customer wont be coming back this is the most common mistake of the amateurs going for big numbers to satisfy their managers anyway the dry shine the first thing i mean to do and this part is very important i clean the shoe the residue and old polish to keep the shoe from being ruined all you need to do is use a rag with some cleaning fluid if the shoes all caked up with gunk you need to think the shoe cant breathe and thats what causes the feet to stink they took carfoine off the market i believe it was a few years ago cause that leather couldnt breathe now once youve cleaned the shoe and its dried your base coat of polish can now be applied then you brush cause what that tends to do is clean the shoe a little more and gets rid of the residue and then you do the second coat just like the first one you brush it you rag it and voila your work is done and thats it you treat each shoe like its special care about your work and be a professional theres a right way to go about your job and a wrong one i find this way is much better in the long run it aint about the dollar or trying to go fast unless you take pride in what youre doing it wont last craftsmanship is a quality that some lack you got to give people a reason for them to come back the worlds a different place than what i was introduced to they dont wear shineable shoes like they used to casual clothes in the office what is this the villain in sneakers is killing my business

To Say the Very Least		Vertex	more often than not whats worth owning is worth fighting for whether it be life love and the pursuit of happiness moms apple pie or even something as basic as sex and dont go knocking it that three letter word makes a mockery of the four letter onces that tries to cheaping it its a wonderful game for people of all ages and even for losers its worth a try thats good morning and good bye  they sit in your section they think you gentle and nice you bring glasses of water with lentils and rice old fashioned outfits that also appears that gratuities are greater when you dont wear brasires they give you their orders and watch when you write them wishing that you could be there menu item they wanna be breast fed the day you get work off if you in their thoughts they walk home and then jerk off you look like a model so young and intrepid the regular customers are old and decrepit the food is here rotten but the service is stellar i know that i love her and i wish i could tell her but they dont know your name cause you dont really care as long as they tip you and stay in their chair they swallow their tongues and the venom of 30 vipers if you tell them a lie and changes the dirty diapers
The Blues, Pt. 1		Vertex	a game worth winnin from the beginnin of the first inning an essential day off since its provincial playoffs and im playin shortstop batting fourth in the line up the opposing pitchers a right hander with an unorthodox wind up and a good move to first throws a curve and changes speeds can be wild at times and known to blow the strangest leads like the last time we faced him he turned one savage lead into a loss for his team and inflated his earned run average but today he seems focused and we were stuck out to dry in the top of the first cause he struck out the side but in the bottom half the bad guys came out swingin a lot of coaches like to choose takin the same route bringing the big hitters to the plate and players that are purely speed and try to manufacture runs and jump out to an early lead and this time it worked so we were gonna need a hero cause after one complete the scores already 3 to 0 leadin off the second i swung at the first pitch no wonder the center fielder back peddled to the track and settled under it 0 for 1 and cant get goin the balls thrown around the horn and back to the pitcher now and all is going good for the bad guys but not so hot for the visitors the big right hander is takin no prisoners he seems to have us figured out the question is can we compete hes pitching perfect after 3 complete and has a 3 1 lead top of the fourth and our lead off hitter makes it to first base and here we go its the worst case scenario for any opposing pitcher because he got a reckon that the first chance he gets hes gonna try to steal second which he does so for the first time during the mission weve got nobody out and a man in scoring position the next batter flies out to right but yo word thats still only one out and a runner on third so then the number 3 hitter steps up to the conventional talk showin where hell hit but draws the intentional walk its an old maneuver they made cause trouble may follow unless they get the double play from the clean up hitter and thats me the infielders set up a double play depth when theyre ready but i smack a line drive into left center for a double bringing two across which just leaves it up to me to do the damage in the clean up spot cause now the score was 3 to 2 the score remained the same through five past hits to pretense we kept it close with a dazzling display of defense we had to pull the starting pitcher the one that was left handed the story of the sixth inning was base runners left stranded and bullpen activity but still the job is gettin it done after a perfectly executed hit and run and what may later prove to be the ultimate game winning catch we got a tie game going into the seventh inning stretch
Memory Is Parallax		Vertex	suger in the gastank and sand in the vasoline buck 65 and foreign currencies just in case and for emergencies i keep double copies single pairs of plastic explosive if i need them for signal flairs goshdarnit im the intesifying image of your last hope incarnate five percent fairytale and ninety five of me is hardwork and i rarely fail even though im very pale i wear a suit of armor and in the summer time i ride my bike and get a farmers tan forty one to thirty and im ok for hours backstage at the showcase i want bouquets of flowers a large order of frieds and im sort of surprised because the same thing happened in the lord of the flies when piggy lost his glasses and got crushed by a boulder thanks and no and even though im touched i am older 47516 all i needs a flexed wrist stupid djs would give their right arm to be ambidextrous the path of radical thought is mathematical i substract distractions in addition to inhibitions now cmon everybody click your heels and do the dorothy dont go lookin for trees through the forestry ill calmy and gladly tell your mommy and daddy that their little baby girl is part of an experiment i never meant to scare anyone ive been honest ive been nice but i feel like im skating on thin ice and my skates need sharpening i got hardwood floors but i cover them up with some nice shag carpeting ive pulled whole lotsa dollars out of whole lotsa pockets but life is still just a big old bowl of cherries and luck berries to chew on and any kind of fruit juice i used to always either have a bleeding nose or loose tooth that was in the seventies ill tell ya ladies and gentlemen that after bein in the nineties replaced the eighties adrenalin these be the things that the world says to censor and it will snap your head back like an old fashioned pez dispenser so try to stay on top of it in fact knowing opposites attract the best thing might be to open windows for security as we slip into obscurity and something more comfortable try to bear in mind that memory is parallax

Dirtbike 1, song 19			can hear a train coming im sitting on the track writing down the words that are written on your back shoulders bare blades for protection from the slaughter and your eyes trade secrets with your reflection in the water suffering from sleep the disease of your energy the lighthouse searches the open seas of your memory before us the forest where they cut down the young trees looking for hero for instance princes amongst thieves prisoners and suicides who decides the deadline knives come out as we get ready for bedtime covered in teeth marks we follow the misleading some think of it as patience i think of it as bleeding unheard the word a manifest meanders we listen to new music and i request the standards sick of the sight im not picking a fight i seem to slowly disappear but its a trick of the light one hundred reasons is sufficient to change still waters run deep and i wish it would rain when he walked across the surface jesus was a sailor clutch ring theres no such thing a failure theres one way out one symbol one token the ocean is bottomless the serpent is unbroken eating its tail reading its mail asleep grieving victims and dictums i caution you to keep breathing wounded imagination and the figments be in stitches as we keep seeking our dignity in ditches when the clock struck zero it was every man for himself callous and underhanded alice in wonderlanded this me as a life she as a wife cutting the ropes using a key as a knife medicine taken a broken promise a penny saved it doesnt feel good but i still do it anyway twin peaks soundbite serial killers dont kill their girlfriends they prefer the company of strangers hes out there somewhere diane but a town like this is like a river lots of hidden currents and eddies concealing their own secrets i havent even broken the surface yet
