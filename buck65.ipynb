    "Ever since coming across [Matt Daniel's Rapper Vocabulary Chart](https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html), I've been interested in how one of my favorite rappers -- Buck 65 -- would place on there. To find that, I'll be getting as many lyrics as I can from LyricsGenius to get up to 35,000 lyrics in accordance with the original methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "35,000 words covers 3-5 studio albums and EPs. I included mixtapes if the artist was just short of the 35,000 words. Quite a few rappers don’t have enough official material to be included (e.g., Biggie, Kendrick Lamar). As a benchmark, I included data points for Shakespeare and Herman Melville, using the same approach (35,000 words across several plays for Shakespeare, first 35,000 of Moby Dick).\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a research methodology called token analysis to determine each artist’s vocabulary. Each word is counted once, so pimps, pimp, pimping, and pimpin are four unique words. To avoid issues with apostrophes (e.g., pimpin’ vs. pimpin), they’re removed from the dataset. It still isn’t perfect. Hip hop is full of slang that is hard to transcribe (e.g., shorty vs. shawty), compound words (e.g., king shit), featured vocalists, and repetitive choruses.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With those lyrics, I'll be cleaning the data to remove apostrophes and (possibly) other special characters, and then using NLTK to break the lyrics into tokens and count the number of individual words.\n",

    "So far, we have gathered, sorted, and cleaned all of the lyrics from Buck 65's Genius entry. We can see that we have 297,778 individual lyrics across 163 songs. The first step then is to narrow that down to the 35,000 used in the original project. More specifically, we need to get the (chronologically) first 35,000 words. To do that, we'll need a list of his albums, which I've gotten from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_65_discography).
